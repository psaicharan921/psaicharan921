## 🏢 Professional Experience

### ICS / SCADA Support Engineer — Enbridge, Cleveland, OH
- Support Gas Control SCADA, ensuring secure and reliable communication between control centers and remote field sites.  
- Manage AVEVA SCADA via ADE (IP updates, adding/removing remote sites, controlled reboots) and troubleshoot HMI errors to maintain process visibility and uptime.  
- Validate gas control data using Measurement Advisor and administer access via Active Directory and Network Management Console in line with OT cybersecurity policies.  

### Control Engineer — LogistiQ, Port Clinton, OH
- Developed and tuned PLC logic for conveyor zones, merges, and sortation equipment, stabilizing timing, interlocks, and material flow.  
- Performed full I/O verification, wiring validation, and device integration (motors, drives, sensors, safety devices) to remove bottlenecks and jam-prone areas.  
- Verified safety circuits and ensured commissioning practices complied with OSHA and NFPA 70E requirements.  

### Controls Engineer — Bastian Solutions, Cincinnati, OH
- Designed PLC logic, interlocks, and motion sequences for material-handling machinery to achieve predictable and fault-tolerant operation.  
- Tuned drive parameters (ramps, speeds, torque thresholds) to improve motion quality and reduce mechanical stress, while analyzing downtime to eliminate recurring faults.  
- Executed safety verification (E‑stops, guard interlocks, zone safety) and supported field commissioning and end‑user handover.  

### Robotics Simulation Engineer — TCS ION, Pune, IN
- Built virtual automation environments and control logic to simulate full machine sequences, detecting timing and interlock issues before deployment.  
- Validated fail-safe behavior, shutdown and recovery sequences, and abnormal operating scenarios to ensure predictable and safe responses.  

### Automation Engineer — Expert Hub Industry, TN, India
- Integrated sensors, actuators, and field devices into small-scale automation and monitoring systems, ensuring consistent signal behavior.  
- Validated wiring and signal paths, resolving noise and connection issues, and documenting system behavior for maintenance and future design updates.
